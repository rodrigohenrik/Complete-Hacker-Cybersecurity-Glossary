| **Smurf Attack** | A type of DDoS that exploits IP and ICMP to flood a target with spoofed traffic, causing network disruption. |
| **Race Condition** | A software vulnerability where timing flaws allow attackers to manipulate processes running in parallel. |
| **Session Hijacking** | Taking over a legitimate user session, often by stealing session cookies, to gain unauthorized access. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | An automated attack where stolen username/password pairs are used to attempt login on multiple services. |
| **Cold Boot Attack** | A physical attack where data is retrieved from memory (RAM) after a system is restarted, taking advantage of residual data. |
| **Air Gap Attack** | Techniques used to breach systems physically isolated from the internet (air-gapped), often through unconventional methods like electromagnetic emissions. |
| **Supply Chain Attack** | Compromising software or hardware during development or distribution to gain access to the end user. |
| **Cloud Jacking** | Unauthorized access or control over cloud-based infrastructure or services, often for data theft or resource exploitation. |
| **Cyber Espionage** | The act of spying via cyber means to obtain sensitive or classified information, typically state-sponsored or corporate. |
| **Code Injection** | The act of inserting malicious code into an application to change its behavior or extract data. |
| **Reverse Shell** | A technique where a compromised system initiates a connection to the attacker, providing control over the machine. |
